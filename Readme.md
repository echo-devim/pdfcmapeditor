# PDF Cmap Editor
This is a simple python script to edit the ToUnicode Cmap in a pdf file.

Read the [explanation](https://github.com/echo-devim/pdfcmapeditor/raw/master/Cmap_explanation.pdf).

I written this script just for fun in a little slot of free-time. There are a lot of situations where the script won't work (for example if there is more than one ToUnicode Cmap or if there isn't anyone).
